In this folder you should put any processed versions of your data. Common 
examples are preprocessing steps of recorded data and paramter fits of 
models. The data structure should match the one in the data folder.

This folder is not synchronized to Github or version control, but should 
be synchronized in a shareable manner through OneDrive or a similar 
service such that it is available and synchronized to all your devices and 
can be given to other lab members easily.

Upon completion of the project this folder with its contents will be part 
of the materials we publish through OSF or similar means.

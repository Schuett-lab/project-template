In this folder, you should place all contents for conferences and 
meetings, i.e. talks, posters, abstracts etc. Name the files starting with 
the date (at least the year) and a name for the place where presentations 
is/was/will be given.

This folder is not synchronized to Github or version control, but should 
be synchronized in a shareable manner through OneDrive or a similar 
service such that it is available and synchronized to all your devices and 
can be given to other lab members easily.

Upon completion of the project this folder will be archived unpublished.

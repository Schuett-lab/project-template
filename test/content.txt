In this folder you put tests of your code. This should be a machine 
runnable folder, i.e. things that are run by pytest or similar tools for 
other languages automatically. This is not for your computer science 
experiments, debugging, etc.

This folder should be pure code and as such should be synchronized through 
Github under version control.

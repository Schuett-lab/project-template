In this folder you should place data that is collected for this project in 
raw format, i.e. excatly as they were first recorded, but without 
personally identifiable information! 
This folder applies for anything that is of an easy to synchronize size, 
i.e. the total size of this folder should be < 1Gb. If you have more data 
than that, we should organize things properly. 

For purely theoretical projects this folder should be empty.

This folder will not be synchronized to Github usually, but this should be 
synchronized to machines you work on regularly, e.g. through OneDrive and 
this synchronization should be shareable, i.e. you should be able to give 
access to another lab member.

Upon completion of the project the contents of this folder will be part of 
the record that we publish through OSF or similar means.
